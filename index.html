This is an HTML document. It contains information about how elements in the website
are arranged. In other words, it describes the layout of a website.

I can't wait to see the resumes you put together!

The <head> of a website generally links to important resources the page will
need to load. You'll see a lot of <link>s to CSS files for styles and
<scripts> for JavaScript files to build interactions.

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
